== The Stormpot Release Process

This is not really documentation, but rather an "internal" document detailing the release process, so that I don't forget any steps.

* [ ] Verify that the snapshots publish correctly.
* [ ] Run the release workflow.
* [ ] Check out the released tag.
* [ ] Run `./docupdate.sh` and push updated web site.
* [ ] Publish the release on GitHub.
* [ ] Update `pom.xml` to the snapshot of the next version.
* [ ] Announce on mailing list & write blog post.
* [ ] Mark old branch as protected.
