  /**
   * Claim the exclusive rights until released, to an object in the pool.
   * Possibly waiting up to the specified amount of time, as given by the
   * provided {@link Timeout} instance, for one to become available if the
   * pool has been depleted. If the timeout elapses before an object can be
   * claimed, then `null` is returned instead. The timeout will be
   * honoured even if the Allocators {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocate}
   * methods blocks forever. If the given timeout has a zero or negative value,
   * then the method will not wait.
   *
   * If the current thread has already one or more objects currently claimed,
   * then a distinct object will be returned, if one is or becomes available.
   * This means that it is possible for a single thread to deplete the pool, if
   * it so desires. However, doing so is inherently deadlock prone, so avoid
   * claiming more than one object at a time per thread, if at all possible.
   *
   * This method may throw a PoolException if the pool have trouble allocating
   * objects. That is, if its assigned Allocator throws exceptions from its
   * allocate method, or returns `null`.
   *
   * An {@link InterruptedException} will be thrown if the thread has its
   * interrupted flag set upon entry to this method, or is interrupted while
   * waiting. The interrupted flag on the thread will be cleared after
   * this, as per the general contract of interruptible methods.
   *
   * If the pool has been shut down, then an {@link IllegalStateException} will
   * be thrown when this method is called. Likewise if we are waiting for an
   * object to become available, and someone shuts the pool down.
   *
   * Here's an example code snippet, where an object is claimed, printed to
   * `System.out`, and then released back to the pool:
   *
   * [source,java]
   * ----
   * include::../src/test/java/examples/Examples.java[tag=poolClaimPrintExample]
   * ----
   *
   * Memory effects:
   *
   * * The {@link Poolable#release() release} of an object happens-before
   *   any subsequent claim or {@link Allocator#deallocate(Poolable)
   *   deallocation} of that object, and,
   * * The {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocation} of an object
   *   happens-before any claim of that object.
   *
   * @param timeout The timeout of the maximum permitted time-slice to wait for
   * an object to become available. A timeout with a value of zero or less
   * means that the call will do no waiting, preferring instead to return early
   * if no objects are available.
   * @return An object of the Poolable subtype T to which the exclusive rights
   * have been claimed, or `null` if the timeout period elapsed
   * before an object became available.
   * @throws PoolException If an object allocation failed because the Allocator
   * threw an exception from its allocate method, or returned
   * `null`, or the
   * {@link Expiration#hasExpired(SlotInfo) expiration check} threw an
   * exception.
   * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is
   * {@link Thread#interrupt() interrupted} upon entry, or becomes interrupted
   * while waiting.
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the `timeout` argument is `null`.
