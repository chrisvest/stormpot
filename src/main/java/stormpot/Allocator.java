/**
 * An Allocator is responsible for the creation and destruction of
 * {@link Poolable} objects.
 * <p>
 * This is where the objects in the Pool comes from. Clients of the Stormpot
 * library needs to provide their own Allocator implementations.
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface must be thread-safe, because there is no
 * knowing whether pools will try to access it concurrently or not. The easiest
 * way to achieve this is to just make the
 * {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocate}
 * and {@link Allocator#deallocate(Poolable) deallocate} methods synchronised,
 * but this might cause problems for the pools ability to allocate objects fast
 * enough, if they are very slow to construct. Pools might want to deal with
 * very slow allocations by allocating in more than one thread, but
 * synchronizing the {@link #allocate(Slot)} method will render that strategy
 * ineffective.
 * <p>
 * A better approach to thread-safety is to not have any shared mutable state
 * in the allocator, if at all possible.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must also be interruption-safe.
 * When a pool is {@linkplain Pool#shutdown() shut down}, its background
 * allocation thread may be interrupted, and this thread may be interacting
 * with the allocator instance when this happens.

   * Pools, on the other hand, will guarantee that the same object is never
   * deallocated more than once.
   * <p>
   * Note that pools will always silently swallow exceptions thrown by the
   * deallocate method. They do this because there is no knowing whether the
   * deallocation of an object will be done synchronously by a thread calling
   * {@link Poolable#release() release} on a Poolable, or asynchronously by
   * a clean-up thread inside the pool.

   * the shutdown procedure of a {@link Pool} behave the same way in this
   * regard. They will both silently swallow any exception thrown.

   * On the other hand, pools are guaranteed to otherwise correctly deal with
   * any exception that might be thrown. The shutdown procedure will still
   * complete, and release will still maintain the internal data structures of
   * the pool to make the slot available for new allocations.
   * <p>

   * deallocation of objects, then you should do this in the allocator itself,
