/**
 * Objects contained in a {@link Pool} must implement the Poolable interface
 * and adhere to its contract.
 *
 * Pools call {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocate} on Allocators with the
 * specific {@link Slot} that they want a Poolable allocated for. The Slot
 * represents a location in the pool, that can fit an object and make it
 * available for others to claim.
 *
 * The contract of the Poolable interface is, that when {@link #release()} is
 * called on the Poolable, it must in turn call {@link Slot#release(Poolable)}
 * on the specific Slot object that it was allocated with, giving itself as the
 * Poolable parameter.
 *
 * A simple correct implementation of the Poolable interface looks like this:
 *
 * [source,java,indent=0]
 * ----
 * include::src/test/java/examples/Examples.java[tag=poolableGenericExample]
 * ----
 *
 * This can be shortened further by extending the {@link BasePoolable} class:
 *
 * [source,java,indent=0]
 * ----
 * include::src/test/java/examples/Examples.java[tag=poolableBaseExample]
 * ----
 *
 * It is also possible to directly use the {@link Pooled} implementation, which
 * implements both `Poolable` and {@link AutoCloseable}, and holds a
 * reference to the actual object being pooled.
 *
 * Memory effects: The release of an object happens-before it is claimed
 * by another thread, or deallocated.

public interface Poolable {
  /**
   * Release this Poolable object back into the pool from where it came,

   * A call to this method MUST delegate to a call to
   * {@link Slot#release(Poolable)} on the Slot object for which this
   * Poolable was allocated, giving itself as the Poolable parameter.
   *
   * A Poolable can be released by a thread other than the one that claimed it.
   * It can not, however, be released more than once per claim. The feature of
   * permitting releases from threads other than the claiming thread might be
   * useful in message-passing architectures and the like, but it is not
   * generally recommendable because it makes it more complicated to keep track
   * of object life-cycles.
   *
   * Great care must be taken, to ensure that Poolables are not used after they
   * are released!
