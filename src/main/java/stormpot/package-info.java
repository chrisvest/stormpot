/**
 * <h2>Stormpot</h2>
 * Stormpot is a generic, thread-safe and fast object pooling library.
 * <p>
 * The object pools themselves implement the {@link stormpot.Pool} interface.
 * The things you actually want to pool must all implement the
 * {@link stormpot.Poolable} interface, and you must also provide an
 * implementation of the {@link stormpot.Allocator} interface as a factory to
 * create your pooled objects.
 * <p>
 * See the online
 * <a href="http://chrisvest.github.io/stormpot/usage.html">Usage Guide</a>
 * for a tutorial.
