 * Pool builder instances are obtained by calling one of the {@code from*}

 * This class is made thread-safe by having the fields be protected by the
 * intrinsic object lock on the {@code PoolBuilder} object itself. This way, pools
 * can {@code synchronize} on the builder object to read the values out atomically.
