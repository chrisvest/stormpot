/**
 * A Pool is a self-renewable set of objects from which one can claim exclusive
 * access to elements, until they are released back into the pool.
 *
 * Pools are thread-safe, and their {@link #claim(Timeout)} methods can be
 * called concurrently from multiple threads.
 * This is a strictly stronger guarantee than {@link PoolTap} provides.
 *
 * Pools extend the {@link PoolTap} class, which provides the API for accessing
 * the objects contained in the pool.
 *
 * Pools contain {@link Poolable} objects. When you claim an object in a pool,
 * you also take upon yourself the responsibility of eventually
 * {@link Poolable#release() releasing} that object again. By far the most
 * common idiom to achieve this is with a `try-finally` clause:
 *
 * [source,java,indent=0]
 * ----
 * include::src/test/java/examples/Examples.java[tag=poolClaimExample]
 * ----
 *
 * The pools are resizable, and can have their capacity changed at any time
 * after they have been created.
 *
 * All pools are configured with a certain size, the number of objects that the
 * pool will have allocated at any one time, and they can change this number on
 * the fly using the {@link #setTargetSize(int)} method. The change does not
 * take effect immediately, but instead moves the "goal post" and leaves the
 * pool to move towards it at its own pace.
 *
 * No guarantees can be made about when the pool will actually reach the target
 * size, because it might depend on how long it takes for a certain number of
 * objects to be released back into the pool.
 *
 * [NOTE]
 * --
 * Pools created with {@link Pool#of(Object[])} are _not_ resizable, and calling
 * {@link Pool#setTargetSize(int)} or {@link ManagedPool#setTargetSize(int)} will
 * cause an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
 * --
 *
 * Pools are themselves life-cycled, and should be {@link #shutdown() shut down}
 * when they are no longer needed.
 *
 * Note that Pools are not guaranteed to have overwritten the
 * `Object#finalize()` method. Pools are expected to rely on explicit
 * clean-up for releasing their resources.
