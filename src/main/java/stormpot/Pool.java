/**
 * A Pool is a self-renewable set of objects from which one can claim exclusive
 * access to elements, until they are released back into the pool.
 * <p>
 * Pools are thread-safe, and their {@link #claim(Timeout)} methods can be
 * called concurrently from multiple threads.
 * This is a strictly stronger guarantee than {@link PoolTap} provides.
 * <p>
 * Pools extend the {@link PoolTap} class, which provides the API for accessing
 * the objects contained in the pool.
 * <p>
 * Pools contain {@link Poolable} objects. When you claim an object in a pool,
 * you also take upon yourself the responsibility of eventually
 * {@link Poolable#release() releasing} that object again. By far the most
 * common idiom to achieve this is with a {@code try-finally} clause:
 * {@snippet class=Examples region=poolClaimExample }
 * <p>
 * The pools are resizable, and can have their capacity changed at any time
 * after they have been created.
 * <p>
 * All pools are configured with a certain size, the number of objects that the
 * pool will have allocated at any one time, and they can change this number on
 * the fly using the {@link #setTargetSize(int)} method. The change does not
 * take effect immediately, but instead moves the "goal post" and leaves the
 * pool to move towards it at its own pace.
 * <p>
 * No guarantees can be made about when the pool will actually reach the target
 * size, because it might depend on how long it takes for a certain number of
 * objects to be released back into the pool.
 *
 * <table>
 * <caption>Note</caption>
 * <tr>
 * <th scope="row">NOTE</th>
 * <td>
 * Pools created with {@link Pool#of(Object[])} are <em>not</em> resizable, and calling
 * {@link Pool#setTargetSize(int)} or {@link ManagedPool#setTargetSize(int)} will
 * cause an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} to be thrown.
 * </td>
 * </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Pools are themselves life-cycled, and should be {@link #shutdown() shut down}
 * when they are no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * Note that Pools don't override the deprecated {@code Object.finalize()} method.
 * Pools are expected to rely on explicit clean-up for releasing their resources.
