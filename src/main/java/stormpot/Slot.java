/**
 * A Slot represents a location in a Pool where objects can be allocated into,
 * so that they can be claimed and released. The Slot is used by the allocated
 * Poolables as a call-back, to tell the pool when an object is released.
 * <p>
 * The individual pool implementations provide their own Slot implementations.
 * <p>
 * Slots contain mutable state within them. If objects are claimed, released
 * and otherwise worked on from different threads, then the hand-over must
 * happen through a safe publication mechanism.
 * <p>
 * See Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz for more information on safe
 * publication.
 * <p>
 * Slots also expects single-threaded access, so they cannot be used
 * concurrently by multiple threads. Only one thread at a time can use a Slot
 * instance.

   * Mark the object represented by this slot as expired. Expired objects
   * cannot be claimed again, and will be deallocated by the pool at the
   * earliest convenience. Objects are normally expired automatically using
   * the {@link Expiration} policy that the pool has been configured with. If
   * an object through its use is found to be unusable, then it can be
   * explicitly expired using this method. Objects can only be explicitly
   * expired while they are claimed, and such expired objects will not be
   * deallocated until they are released back to the pool.
   * <p>
   * It is a user error to expire objects that are not currently claimed. It is
   * likewise a user error to expire a Slot while inside the Allocators
   * {@link Allocator#allocate(Slot) allocate} method.
   * <p>
   * The expiration only takes effect after the object has been released, so
   * calling this method from within the Expirations
   * {@link Expiration#hasExpired(SlotInfo) hasExpired} method will not prevent
   * the object from being claimed, but will prevent it from being claimed
   * again after it's been released back to the pool. An Expiration policy that
   * expires all objects with this method, is effectively allowing objects to
   * only be claimed once.

   * Pools are free to throw a PoolException if they detect any wrong uses,
