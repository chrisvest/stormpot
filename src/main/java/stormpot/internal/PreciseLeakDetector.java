    // least significant 5 bits are the index into the first-level 32 element
    // 'probe' array. When inserting, if that slot is null, then we insert the
    // WeakRef directly into that place. In fact, we allow building a WeakRef
    // chain up to 4 elements long, directly in the first-level 'probes' array.
    // Otherwise, we add the second-level 32 element array, rehash the existing
    // chain into it, by using the next 5 second-least significant bits as
    // index. From here on, we don't create any more levels, but just link the
    // WeakRefs together like a daisy-chain. This way, we create at most 33
    // arrays, with room for 1024 objects. Most pools probably won't need to
    // have more than that many objects registered at a time.
